# Modelling practices in water governance: a book for alternative approaches 

## Why this book?

This book was an idea stemming from the Constructive Advanced Thinking project on [Modelling practices in water governance](https://cat-water-models.github.io). In our [perspective paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/wat2.70030), we proposed situating hydrological models as a way to more explicitly mobilize modeling for just water transformation. We also sketched initial, promising attempts to do so, highlighting their potential to support reflexivity, pluralism, and just transformations in water-society relations. 

Such efforts require evolving political, epistemological, and ethical routines and practices that defy fixed guidelines. Inspired by feminist scholarship, we argue that there is no single way to situate hydrological models—multiple, context-specific approaches are both possible and necessary. Therefore, we invite the water research community from all traditions to engage creatively and join us in modeling differently. 

This book is intended to foster cross-learning between communities interested in reflexive, power-sensitive, and situated modeling. It is one way to bring together a diverse collection of on-going, open-ended, and partial attempts at reflecting on and practicing hydrological modeling (there are, of course, other ways—such as in-person dialogues). It is open for contributions include case studies—whether published or not—offered by researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of water and society. 

Importantly, this is a **living book**—an evolving resource meant to grow over time. Some chapters may expand, others may be revised or replaced. It remains open to contributions from anyone interested in situating modeling differently. The book is also a free educational resource, offering real-life examples for students and educators who want to understand how models can be mobilized for more just and transformative water governance. As editors, our role is simply to maintain the original idea and support its continued development.
