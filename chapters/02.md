# Toward New Modeling Practicesâ€”Learning from Case Studies

Examples of attempts to
- Open debate about which political concerns models address, and what futures they enable or constrain
- Reframe objectivity as situated, shaped by positionalities and contexts
- (By modellers) engage in reflexivity, (auto)ethnography, and critical inquiry (by modellers) 
- (By non-modellers) engage productively with modeling processes, translating insights into practical propositions for collaboration
