# Current modelling practices

A collection of works that
- Explore how modeling practices are shaped by their social, epistemic, material, institutional, political, historical, and ethical contexts
- Question who is involved in modeling processes and how these unfold
- Attend to the specificities of each water issue, asking whether—and in what ways—hydrological models can meaningfully support just transformations
